possum lang - v0.01

meant to be a semi-esoteric language
it's basically just a small subset of lisp
with fixed-arity functions and implicit grouping

e.g.
print minus plus plus 1 5 3 1
is like
(print (minus (plus (plus 1 5) 3) 1))

TODO:
- add function definition
- make python function definitions infer arity
- actually parse strings
- make parser work with multiple toplevel statements
- add typechecking and signatures
- diagnostics
- stdlib
- at least somewhat verify correctness
- modules (or at least including)
- unit tests
- clean up code (heh, yeah right)
- document code (hah, hah-hah...)

 Open questions:
- should operators use symbols or names? (e.g. + - / or plus minus div)
- should we have an atom quote operator?
  (e.g. 'x which returns an atom rather than the value of x)
  so we could do stuff like set 'x 5 rather than set "x" 5
