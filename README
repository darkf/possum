meant to be a semi-esoteric language
it's basically just a small subset of a pseudo-lisp
with fixed-arity functions and implicit grouping

e.g.
print minus plus plus 1 5 3 1
is like
(print (minus (plus (plus 1 5) 3) 1))

here's a more sophisticated example (ported from scheme)

 defun list-sum 1 x
   cond 3
     or nil? x empty? x
       0
     pair? car x
       plus list-sum car x list-sum cdr x
     true
       plus car x list-sum cdr x
       
 set "lst" cons 1 cons 2 cons 3 nil
 print list-sum lst


TODO:
- actually parse strings
- add typechecking and signatures
- diagnostics
- stdlib
- at least somewhat verify correctness
- modules (or at least including)
- unit tests
- clean up code (heh, yeah right)
- document code (hah, hah-hah...)
